# Data Science Wiki
{: .fs-9 }

Every topic a Data Scientist encounters in his daily work shall be treated in this Data Science Wiki.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started

As a researcher at the interface between data science and finance, I find it important to make resources as easily accessible as possible. Often the environment is very confusing and it can take a long time to find the appropriate documentation for a question. The Data Science Wiki should give an easy introduction to the topic and cover a wide range of questions. Since it is too extensive to cover everything, references to further sources are given at certain points.

*I hope you enjoy this Wiki and can use it in your everyday life.*
